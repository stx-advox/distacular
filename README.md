# Distacular
a bot to manage MicroDAOs (mDAO) through discord slash commands

## Features

### Create mDAO

Easy af 

just pick a name separated by dashes if more than one word like my-dao, dao, dao-100, as this is gonna be the mDAO's contract name

pick the dissent period from 1 day (144 bitcoin blocks) up to 5 days (5 * 144 bitcoin blocks)

if you don't wanna be alone (which is okay), pick your fellow members (you don't need to include yourself) using the member1, member2,.... member7 fields

press enter and you'll have a link where you would confirm the mDAO deployment with your web wallet


### Create funding proposal

just put the description, specify grantees and grant amounts from 1 and up to 10 grants are possible

then you'll have to select the DAO and afterwards you'll have a link to confirm the funding proposal creation transaction using your web wallet 


### Dissent
select the mDAO and then the proposal you'd like to dissent to, and you'll get a link to confirm the bla bla bla using your bla bla bla

### Execute funding proposal

select mDAO then proposal then link would be to confirm execution

### Get proposal data
